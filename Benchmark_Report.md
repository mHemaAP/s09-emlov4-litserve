### Experiment Explanation:

In this series of experiments, server and client configurations were optimized incrementally to improve throughput and reduce bottlenecks in deploying a Cat-Dog/Dog-Breed classifier with LitServe. 

**Experiment 1** served as a baseline with no batching or worker configurations, yielding suboptimal GPU and CPU utilization due to lack of concurrency. 

**Experiment 2** introduced batch processing, slightly improving throughput as the server began to handle requests more efficiently by aggregating them. 

**Experiment 3** Adding workers significantly boosted performance by parallelizing request processing, leveraging multi-core CPU resources. 

**Experiment 4** Transitioning to float16 precision further optimized GPU utilization and throughput by reducing computational overhead, though with some trade-offs in single-threaded performance. 

**Experiment 5** Tuning batch timeout 

**Experiment 6** max batch size refined batching behavior, leading to a balance between throughput and latency. Overall, the incremental optimizations showcased progressive utilization of hardware capabilities, with GPU and CPU reaching near-maximum efficiencies at higher concurrency levels and tuned configurations.

### Theoretical Maximum Throughput

The theoretical maximum throughput represents the upper bound of requests per second that a server can process under ideal conditions. It is determined by:

Hardware limitations (GPU computation capacity, CPU, memory bandwidth).
Precision (lower precision like float16 reduces computational load, allowing more inferences).
Concurrency and batching efficiency (more concurrent threads/workers leverage the hardware optimally).

*To calculate the theoretical maximum throughput:*

Estimate the time for a single inference at peak GPU usage (e.g., based on the maximum GPU utilization observed in the benchmarks).
Divide 1 by the inference time to get the per-second throughput.
Multiply by the batch size and the number of workers to factor in parallel processing.
For your experiments, **maximum GPU usage (82.7%) and batch size 256** **with float16** suggest near-optimal GPU utilization. The server may approach ~300 reqs/sec under perfect conditions, considering diminishing returns beyond these optimizations.

### Theoretical Calculation

- T4 GPU TFLOPS - Float 32 - 8.1

- T4 GPU TFLOPS - Float 16 - 65

Get FLOPs of your model - `python tests/test_flops.py`

**Float 32 - Thoeretical throughput**

- Custom Model FLOPS = 4.45×10^9 = 4.45 GB FLOPS

- T4 GPU = 8.1 * 10^12 = 8000.1 GFLOPS or 8.1 TFLOPS

- Theoretical time (in seconds)= GPU TFLOPs / (FLOPs of Model)
​​

- Theoretical time = 4.45 / 8000.1 = 0.000549 seconds = 549 micro seconds

*Thoeretical throughput*

- Thoeretical throughput (request/second) = (GPU TFLOPS * 10^12)/(MODEL FLOPS)

- Inference per second = 1/ 549 micro second = 1820 request per second

With 64 batchsize we were able to get only `160.85 reqs/sec` in api serving and we have not yet reached even near the practical baseline throughput model also

**Float 16**

- Custom Model FLOPS = 4.45×10^9 = 4.45 GB FLOPS
T4 GPU = 8.1 * 10^12 = 65000.1 GFLOPS or 65.1 TFLOPS

- Theoretical time (in seconds)= GPU TFLOPs / (FLOPs of Model)
​​
- Theoretical time = 4.45 / 65000.1 = 6.83×10^(-5) seconds

**Thoeretical throughput**

- Thoeretical throughput (request/second) = (GPU TFLOPS * 10^12)/(MODEL FLOPS)

- Inference per second = 1/ 6.83×10^(-5) = 14,640 request per second

With 256 batchsize we were able to get only `152.51 reqs/sec` in api serving and we have not yet reached even near the practical baseline throughput model also
